# 234009303 - Vishnuvasan Raghuraman

## CSCE 685 - Spring '25: Project Description
This project explores fault diagnosis in digital circuits inspired by Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) using simulation, Bayesian inference, and sensitivity analysis.

## Repository Structure
- fault_modeling.py
- bayesian_diagnosis.py
- sensitivity_analysis.py
- main.ipynb (full demo)

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
   pip install matplotlib networkx
2. Open main.ipynb and run all cells.
